# LLM Interaction Log

## Entry 1: source_row_id = 6

**Rationale:** The `device_type` was empty and could not be determined by programmatic rules. The hostname `local-test` and IP `127.0.0.1` suggested a local test machine, requiring LLM classification.

**Prompt:**
```
Please use a low temperature setting (<= 0.2) for this query.

Given the following data from a network inventory CSV row:
- source_row_id: 6
- ip: 127.0.0.1
- hostname: local-test
- owner: 
- raw_device_type: 
- notes: N/A

Classify the device into one of these standard categories: ['server', 'workstation', 'router', 'switch', 'firewall', 'access-point', 'iot-device', 'printer', 'unknown'].

Provide the output in a single, minified JSON object with two keys: 'device_type' (the classified category) and 'confidence' (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{"device_type":"server","confidence":0.85}
```
---

## Entry 2: source_row_id = 7

**Rationale:** The `device_type` was empty, and the IP address was from the APIPA range, indicating a client device that failed to get a DHCP lease. This ambiguity required LLM classification.

**Prompt:**
```
Please use a low temperature setting (<= 0.2) for this query.

Given the following data from a network inventory CSV row:
- source_row_id: 7
- ip: 169.254.10.20
- hostname: host-apipa
- owner: 
- raw_device_type: 
- notes: 

Classify the device into one of these standard categories: ['server', 'workstation', 'router', 'switch', 'firewall', 'access-point', 'iot-device', 'printer', 'unknown'].

The IP address 169.254.10.20 is an APIPA address, suggesting a client device that failed to get a DHCP lease.

Provide the output in a single, minified JSON object with two keys: 'device_type' (the classified category) and 'confidence' (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{"device_type":"workstation","confidence":0.9}
```

## Entry 3: Batch Classification for source_row_id = 9, 10, 11, 12, 15

**Rationale:** To improve efficiency, the remaining ambiguous `device_type` entries were processed in a single batch request to the LLM.

**Prompt:**
```
Please use a low temperature setting (<= 0.2) for this query.

You are a data cleaning assistant. Your task is to classify the `device_type` for a list of network inventory records. The input is a JSON array of objects, where each object contains the data for one device.

The output MUST be a JSON array of objects. Each object in your output array must contain the `source_row_id` and your classification result (`device_type` and `confidence`).

The standard categories for `device_type` are: ['server', 'workstation', 'router', 'switch', 'firewall', 'access-point', 'iot-device', 'printer', 'unknown'].

Analyze the provided `ip`, `hostname`, and `notes` for each device to make your classification.

**Input Data:**
```json
[
  {
    "source_row_id": "9",
    "ip": "abc.def.ghi.jkl",
    "hostname": "badhost",
    "notes": ""
  },
  {
    "source_row_id": "10",
    "ip": "192.168.1.-1",
    "hostname": "neg",
    "notes": ""
  },
  {
    "source_row_id": "11",
    "ip": "192.168.1.255",
    "hostname": "bcast",
    "notes": "Potential broadcast"
  },
  {
    "source_row_id": "12",
    "ip": "192.168.1.0",
    "hostname": "netid",
    "notes": "Potential network id"
  },
  {
    "source_row_id": "15",
    "ip": "N/A",
    "hostname": "missing-ip",
    "notes": ""
  }
]
```

**Please provide your response in a single, minified JSON array matching this exact format:**
```json
[
  {"source_row_id": "9", "device_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0},
  {"source_row_id": "10", "device_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0},
  {"source_row_id": "11", "device_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0},
  {"source_row_id": "12", "device_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0},
  {"source_row_id": "15", "device_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0}
]
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
[
  {"source_row_id":"9","device_type":"unknown","confidence":0.95},
  {"source_row_id":"10","device_type":"unknown","confidence":0.9},
  {"source_row_id":"11","device_type":"unknown","confidence":0.95},
  {"source_row_id":"12","device_type":"unknown","confidence":0.95},
  {"source_row_id":"15","device_type":"unknown","confidence":0.9}
]
```

## Entry 4: Batch Parsing for source_row_id = 2, 4, 5, 8, 13

**Rationale:** To parse ambiguous `owner` strings that do not contain clear email or team information, a batch request was sent to the LLM.

**Prompt:**
```
Please use a low temperature setting (<= 0.2) for this query.

You are a data cleaning assistant. Your task is to parse the `owner` string from a list of network inventory records.

For each record, analyze the `owner` string and perform the following actions:
1.  Identify the responsible team or department and place it in the `owner_team` field.
2.  Infer a standardized email address based on the team name, using the format `team@corp.example.com`. If no reasonable team name can be identified, leave `owner_email` as null.

The output MUST be a JSON array of objects. Each object in your output array must contain the `source_row_id` and your parsing result (`owner_team` and `owner_email`).

**Input Data:**
```json
[
  {"source_row_id": "2", "owner": "ops"},
  {"source_row_id": "4", "owner": "Facilities"},
  {"source_row_id": "5", "owner": "sec"},
  {"source_row_id": "8", "owner": "platform"},
  {"source_row_id": "13", "owner": "dns-google"}
]
```

**Please provide your response in a single, minified JSON array matching this exact format:**
```json
[
  {"source_row_id": "2", "owner_team": "...", "owner_email": "..."},
  {"source_row_id": "4", "owner_team": "...", "owner_email": "..."},
  {"source_row_id": "5", "owner_team": "...", "owner_email": "..."},
  {"source_row_id": "8", "owner_team": "...", "owner_email": "..."},
  {"source_row_id": "13", "owner_team": "...", "owner_email": "..."}
]
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
[
  {"source_row_id":"2","owner_team":"operations","owner_email":"operations@corp.example.com"},
  {"source_row_id":"4","owner_team":"facilities","owner_email":"facilities@corp.example.com"},
  {"source_row_id":"5","owner_team":"security","owner_email":"security@corp.example.com"},
  {"source_row_id":"8","owner_team":"platform","owner_email":"platform@corp.example.com"},
  {"source_row_id":"13","owner_team":"google-dns","owner_email":null}
]
```
